[{'title': 'Exploring Well-Being Disparities: A Comparative Analysis of Urban and Rural Clinicians Using the NIOSH Worker Well-Being Questionnaire.', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Clinician well-being is crucial to the healthcare system, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which intensified psychological distress among clinicians. This study examines well-being disparities between rural and urban clinicians using the NIOSH Worker Well-Being Questionnaire (WellBQ).\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 222 clinicians from one urban and three rural hospitals in North Carolina between September and December 2022. The WellBQ assessed well-being across five domains. Data analysis identified concerning thresholds based on positive and negative responses, with discrepancies resolved through independent reviews and focus group validation.\nFINDINGS: In the work evaluation and experience domain, rural hospitals reported concerns with time paucity and work overload, while urban hospitals focused on work-related fatigue and job engagement. Rural hospitals noted issues with job benefits, health programs, and schedule flexibility, whereas urban hospitals emphasized the lack of supportive work culture and management trust. Both settings reported concerns in the physical environment and safety climate domain, including sexual harassment, physical violence, and bullying. Health status concerns in rural hospitals included overall stress and poor mental health, while urban hospitals highlighted chronic health conditions and risky drinking.\nCONCLUSION: This study identified significant well-being disparities between rural and urban clinicians, with urban hospitals showing higher concerning thresholds. Future research should refine these thresholds, explore workplace violence causes, and assess long-term impacts on clinician well-being.Applications to Practice:This study reveals significant well-being disparities between rural and urban clinicians, emphasizing the need for tailored occupational health interventions.', 'keywords': ['The NIOSH WellBQ', 'clinicians', 'thresholds', 'well-being'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40099543'}, {'title': 'Factors Associated with Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Intent to Stay at Current Nursing Position.', 'abstract': "The pandemic exacerbated job stress and burnout among nurses, increasing turnover and intentions to leave, in a workforce struggling with severe shortages. Shortages and turnover are associated with decreased quality of care, poor nurse health, and increased costs. This article reports the findings of a study that sought to identify characteristics of the job, work environment, and psychosocial health outcomes that may predict nurses' intent to stay at their current nursing position within the next year. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, we electronically surveyed working nurses (n = 629) during the summer of 2020 across 36 states. Demographics, work characteristics, and validated measures of anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms were assessed. Logistic regression models identified factors associated with nurses' intent to stay at their jobs. Colleague support, organizational support, and organizational pandemic preparedness were associated with increased odds of intent to stay, while both mild and moderate/severe depressive symptoms were associated with decreased odds of intent to stay. Because over a quarter of nurses surveyed reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, which were strongly associated with turnover intention, organizational leadership should examine mental health resources available to nurses and work characteristics that could be contributing to nurses' poor psychosocial health. Additionally, further research is needed to assess the meaning of organizational support to nurses in a post-COVID-19 context, as well how to create a work environment in which nurses are able to provide support to their colleagues.", 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'Nursing', 'conceptual models', 'intent to stay', 'mental health', 'mixed methods design', 'nurses', 'occupational health', 'turnover', 'turnover intention', 'work environment'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40093384'}, {'title': 'Computer vision syndrome: a comprehensive literature review.', 'abstract': 'Computer Vision Syndrome is a growing health concern in the digital age, with a reported prevalence of 69.0%.

A career locus of control scale and a critical thinking disposition inventory-Chinese version were used.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This study was approved by the Department of Social Science and the School of Medicine of Chengdu University. The researchers explained the purpose of the study to the subjects, so as to obtain their voluntary participation, ensure anonymity and confidentiality, and require each subject to read the informed consent form carefully and have the right to refuse to participate. Two surveys were conducted separately in December 2022 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and March 2024 (during the normal control period of the epidemic) among 227 and 229 undergraduate nursing students, yielding a full response rate of 100%.\nRESULT: There was a correlation between career locus of control and critical thinking, among which career internal control was positively correlated with the score of critical thinking, and low professional efficacy and career opportunities were negatively correlated with the score of critical thinking. Analyticity and inquisitiveness could be used to predict the scores of career internal control, and open-mindedness could be used to predict the scores of critical thinking (β=-0.103). Confidence in reasoning (β=-0.055) could be used to predict the scores of career opportunity. Analyticity and truth-seeking could be used to predict the scores of career external control. The COVID-19 epidemic reduced the career opportunity score by 0.596 points.\nCONCLUSION: Nurse educators should recognise the importance of critical thinking training for nursing students, which enables them to adjust their career locus of control by improving critical thinking and may influence professional expectations, improve self-image within the nursing profession and increase retention of nurses.", 'keywords': ['Education, Medical', 'MEDICAL EDUCATION & TRAINING', 'Nursing research', 'Occupational Health Services', 'Occupational Stress', 'Surveys and Questionnaires'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40032404'}, {'title': 'A Breath of Fresh Air: Pilot Testing Electronic Case Reporting for Public Health Surveillance of Occupational Lung Diseases in Wisconsin.', 'abstract': "CONTEXT: Public health surveillance plays a crucial role in evaluating disease risk and providing timely evidence to policymakers and the public. However, surveillance of many occupational diseases is limited by existing surveillance infrastructure, which is heavily dependent on laboratory tests.\nOBJECTIVE: The present pilot study compared case data for 3 occupational lung diseases (ie, silicosis, asbestosis, and farmer's lung disease) from electronic case reports (eCR) with existing hospital discharge data in the state of Wisconsin to see if eCR-which sends health records directly from clinics when specific criteria are met-provided previously undetected cases of these reportable diseases.\nDESIGN: Case data for 3 reportable occupational lung diseases were pulled from eCR records within the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, a unique identifier was used to match eCR cases to hospital discharge data.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted using administrative data at a state health department to compare data systems and assess the utility of eCR for occupational health surveillance.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number and percentage of matched and unmatched cases were calculated to assess the overlap of the 2 data systems. For eCR cases, the median number of years since diagnosis was also assessed.\nRESULTS: The percentage of eCR cases that could not be matched to hospital discharge data ranged from 55% to 81.2%, depending on the disease of interest. The median length of time since diagnoses for eCR cases was multiple years, suggesting that most had long been missing from existing surveillance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that eCR creates new potential in occupational health surveillance. eCR was found to provide previously undetected cases of occupational lung disease at a state health department and stands to improve the timeliness of case reporting as well.", 'keywords': [], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40020223'}, {'title': 'Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women in the workplace in the Middle East and North Africa: A scoping review protocol.', 'abstract': "INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the livelihoods of working men and women worldwide. The pandemic exacerbated already existing inequities, especially in sectors where women predominate, such as the healthcare, education, and hospitality sectors. Women in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, a world outlier for low female labor force participation despite high female education levels, may have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on women's livelihoods and health is critical to support and retain women in the labor force during external health shocks. However, until now there has been relatively little research on this topic in MENA. Therefore, this scoping review aims to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and wellbeing of women workers in low-and-middle-income countries in the MENA region.\nMETHODS: The outcome of interest is COVID-19 related occupational health (COVID-19 infection related to workplace exposures and pandemic-related occupational stressors) and the impact on mental and physical health among women workers in LMIC in MENA. Academic databases, including APA PsycINFO, Arab World Research Source: Al-Masdar, Global Health, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection will be searched. The study selection process will involve two independent reviewers and data extraction will involve summarizing key information from the included studies using a predefined charting table. The evidence will be analyzed descriptively, providing a comprehensive overview of the identified themes and patterns.\nDISCUSSION: It is anticipated that this review will facilitate a deeper understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on working women in the MENA region.

However, the extant literature on workplace safety tends to focus on safety outcomes of physical accidents and injuries while relegating its conceptual and theoretical development to the background. Psychological safety and psychosocial safety climate in the workplace are essential to workers' health and safety. These concepts are crucial in enabling job satisfaction, work engagement, and performance productivity. Progressing the literature on this subject is necessary to keep abreast with the changing dynamics of the post-COVID challenges, such as working from home, isolation, and stress from AI, among others. A significant gap in the extant literature burrows in the lack of conceptual clarity of workplace safety from a psychological perspective and the poor understanding of its substantive effects on organizations. Hence, re-examining workplace safety's conceptual and theoretical foundations from a psychological lens offers a more nuanced understanding of its potential to contribute to employee well-being and organizational resilience, pursuing a better work-life safe and more comfortable working environment.\nMETHOD: This study: (a) synthesizes the theoretical propositions and empirical findings from 990 research articles published between 2000 and 2023 to map the existing body of knowledge about psychological safety and psychosocial safety climate, including their theoretical underpinnings and mechanisms, to offer a state-of-the-art overview of the scope of workplace occupational health and safety research from a psychological perspective; (b) applied a data-based research design adhering to PRISMA; (c) compiled descriptive synthesis and textual narrative syntheses through bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review; and (d) opens the black box of workplace safety research by presenting significant findings to inform future conceptual, theoretical, and methodological research as well as the practice of workplace safety through the lens of psychology.\nRESULTS: This study's findings further offer managerial implications to workplace safety policy-making and human resource management practices to enhance employees' psychological safety and eliminate workplace psychosocial hazards.", 'keywords': ['Bibliometric analysis', 'Psychological safety', 'Psychosocial safety climate', 'Systematic review'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39998511'}, {'title': "Influence of Psychological Safety and Safety Climate Perceptions on Nurses' Infection Prevention and Occupational Safety Practices and Environment.", 'abstract': 'Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe and examine the relationships among elements of infection prevention practices, the care environment, psychological safety, and safety climate in adult medical surgical units in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Nurses in adult inpatient medical surgical units in the northeast were surveyed electronically. Each self-rated their infection prevention practices and elements of the care environment in their primary work unit. They were also asked to rate a series of questions regarding how psychologically safe they felt on their units as well as the overall patient safety climate. Results: A total of 259 nurses responded (52% response rate) to the survey. Overall psychological safety was rated neutrally among respondents, with a rating of 3.5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest). Respondents reported better ratings of the safety climate on their unit (4.0) but also identified areas for improvement. Eight of twelve infection prevention practices were correlated with higher safety climate scores and ten were correlated with higher psychological safety scores. Nine of ten environmental factors were correlated with higher safety climate and higher psychological safety scores. Conclusions: Both psychological safety and patient safety climate are related to nurse self-ratings of performance of infection prevention practices. Similarly, the care environment nurses work in has important implications for psychological safety and patient safety. It is essential for nursing leadership to act as a steward in these areas to build a higher quality care environment for nurses and patients alike.', 'keywords': ['burnout', 'infection prevention', 'nursing', 'occupational health', 'patient safety', 'psychological safety', 'safety culture'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39997773'}, {'title': 'Working from home is associated with lower odds of inflation stress Among employed US adults in the Household Pulse Survey.', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Recent shifts in hybrid working practices have coincided with rising prices, potentially inducing inflation-related stress among employees.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between remote work status and self-reported inflation-related stress among employed US adults in an overall sample and stratified by gender identity and race/ethnicity.\nMETHODS: We pooled data across 15 survey cycles (September 2022-October 2023) from the US Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey. Remote work status was measured as 0, 1-2, 3-4, and 5\u2009+\u2009days.
